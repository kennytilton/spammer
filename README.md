# SpamUX

How can we use a Web app to get the word out on healthy, effective herbal remedies without being detected by Big Pharma? SpamUX!

## Installation

RSN. This is an exciting first: full-stack Matrix with a Clojure Ring server containing spam gen code and an mxWeb client providing a front-end to the spam gen capabilities. 

We have reached "hello, world" meaning we can kick off a run hard-coded to go against a specific input file. Should be able to document a "hello world" demo today.

## Usage

RSN

## Future work
